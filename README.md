# MAPPO-LCR
MAPPO-LCR: Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization with Local Cooperation Reward in Spatial Public Goods Games 


## Requirements
It is worth mentioning that because python runs slowly, we use cuda library to improve the speed of code running.

```
* Python Version 3.12.2
* CUDA Version: 12.8
* torch Version: 2.2.1
* numpy Version: 1.26.4
* pandas Version: 2.2.3
```

## Installation
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```

The complete code will be released after acceptance.
